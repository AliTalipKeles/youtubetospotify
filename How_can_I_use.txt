1. First, you need to create a Spotify Developer Application.
2. Go to https://developer.spotify.com, sign in, and navigate to the Dashboard.
3. Click "Create an App" and follow the steps.
4. Once your app is created, youâ€™ll see a Client ID and a Client Secret.
5. Copy these values and paste them into your code at lines 13 and 14.
6. Then, go to your app settings and change the Redirect URI to:
   http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback
7. Now you're ready! Run the script, grant the requested permissions in the browser, and paste the URL of the Spotify playlist you want to process.
